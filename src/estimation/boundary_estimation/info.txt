# Boundary Estimation

## Explanation(s):
Boundary Estimation is the package responsible for computing the boundary of the track and the correspondig correct path within it.
It uses as input the SLAM map and compute the result based on the Delaunay triangulation.

## Subscriptions:
`/estimation/online_map`
Where it receives the global map of the cones from SLAM

## Publications:
`/estimation/bounded_path` 
Where it publishes the boundary of the track and the middle points of the path

`/estimation/be_visual_delaunay`
Where it publishes the visualization data, this topic is used for debugging and can be disabled

`/estimation/be_runtime`
Where it publishes the runtime of the algorithm, this topic is used for debugging and can be disabled

## Visualization(s):
One can visualize the Delauney Triangles for debugging.
